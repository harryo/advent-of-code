The count is gone
The previous is empty

Listen to the file
until the file is empty
If the previous isn't empty and the file is bigger than the previous
build the count up

Let the previous be the file
Listen to the file

Shout the count

The coffee is gone
The house is empty

Listen to the office
until the office is empty
If the house isn't empty and the office is bigger than the house
build the coffee up

Let the house be the office
Listen to the office

Shout the coffee
