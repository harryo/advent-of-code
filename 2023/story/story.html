<div id="story"><article class="day-desc" id="day-1"><h2>--- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---</h2><p>Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.</p>
<p>You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all <em class="star">fifty stars</em> by December 25th.</p>
<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class="star">one star</em>. Good luck!</p>
<p>You try to ask why they can't just use a <a href="/2015/day/1">weather machine</a> ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") <span title="My hope is that this abomination of a run-on sentence somehow conveys the chaos of being hastily loaded into a trebuchet.">and</span> hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet" target="_blank">trebuchet</a> ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-2"><h2>--- Day 2: Cube Conundrum ---</h2><p>You're launched high into the atmosphere! The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky. You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It's quite cold, but you don't see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.</p>
<p>The Elf explains that you've arrived at <em>Snow Island</em> and apologizes for the lack of snow. He'll be happy to explain the situation, but it's a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don't get many visitors up here; <span title="No, the Elf's name is not 'WOPR'. It's Joshua.">would you like to play a game</span> in the meantime?</p>
<p>As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.</p>
<p>To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-3"><h2>--- Day 3: Gear Ratios ---</h2><p>You and the Elf eventually reach a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondola_lift" target="_blank">gondola lift</a> station; he says the gondola lift will take you up to the <em>water source</em>, but this is as far as he can bring you. You go inside.</p>
<p>It doesn't take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they're not moving.</p>
<p>"Aaah!"</p>
<p>You turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. "Sorry, I wasn't expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn't working right now; it'll still be a while before I can fix it." You offer to help.</p>
<p>The engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can <em>add up all the part numbers</em> in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-4"><h2>--- Day 4: Scratchcards ---</h2><p>The gondola takes you up. Strangely, though, the ground doesn't seem to be coming with you; you're not climbing a mountain. As the circle of Snow Island recedes below you, an entire new landmass suddenly appears above you! The gondola carries you to the surface of the new island and lurches into the station.</p>
<p>As you exit the gondola, the first thing you notice is that the air here is much <em>warmer</em> than it was on Snow Island. It's also quite <em>humid</em>. Is this where the water source is?</p>
<p>The next thing you notice is an Elf sitting on the floor across the station in what seems to be a pile of colorful square cards.</p>
<p>"Oh! Hello!" The Elf excitedly runs over to you. "How may I be of service?" You ask about water sources.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure; I just operate the gondola lift. That does sound like something we'd have, though - this is <em><span title="I find this way funnier than it has any right to be.">Island Island</span></em>, after all! I bet the <em>gardener</em> would know. He's on a different island, though - er, the small kind surrounded by water, not the floating kind. We really need to come up with a better naming scheme. Tell you what: if you can help me with something quick, I'll let you <em>borrow my boat</em> and you can go visit the gardener. I got all these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratchcard" target="_blank">scratchcards</a> as a gift, but I can't figure out what I've won."</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-5"><h2>--- Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer ---</h2><p>You take the boat and find the gardener right where you were told he would be: managing a giant "garden" that looks more to you like a farm.</p>
<p>"A water source? Island Island <em>is</em> the water source!" You point out that Snow Island isn't receiving any water.</p>
<p>"Oh, we had to stop the water because we <em>ran out of sand</em> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_filter" target="_blank">filter</a> it with! Can't make snow with dirty water. Don't worry, I'm sure we'll get more sand soon; we only turned off the water a few days... weeks... oh no." His face sinks into a look of horrified realization.</p>
<p>"I've been so busy making sure everyone here has food that I completely forgot to check why we stopped getting more sand! There's a ferry leaving soon that is headed over in that direction - it's much faster than your boat. Could you please go check it out?"</p>
<p>You barely have time to agree to this request when he brings up another. "While you wait for the ferry, maybe you can help us with our <em>food production problem</em>. The latest Island Island <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac" target="_blank">Almanac</a> just arrived and we're having trouble making sense of it."</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-6"><h2>--- Day 6: Wait For It ---</h2><p>The ferry quickly brings you across Island Island. After asking around, you discover that there is indeed normally a large pile of sand somewhere near here, but you don't see anything besides lots of water and the small island where the ferry has docked.</p>
<p>As you try to figure out what to do next, you notice a poster on a wall near the ferry dock. "Boat races! Open to the public! Grand prize is an all-expenses-paid trip to <em>Desert Island</em>!" That must be where the sand comes from! Best of all, the boat races are starting in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>You manage to sign up as a competitor in the boat races just in time. The organizer explains that it's not really a traditional race - instead, you will get a fixed amount of time during which your boat has to travel as far as it can, and you win if your boat goes the farthest.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-7"><h2>--- Day 7: Camel Cards ---</h2><p>Your all-expenses-paid trip turns out to be a one-way, five-minute ride in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship" target="_blank">airship</a>. (At least it's a <span title="Please only read this sentence while listening to 'The Airship Blackjack' from the Final Fantasy 6 soundtrack."><em>cool</em> airship</span>!) It drops you off at the edge of a vast desert and descends back to Island Island.</p>
<p>"Did you bring the parts?"</p>
<p>You turn around to see an Elf completely covered in white clothing, wearing goggles, and riding a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromedary" target="_blank">camel</a>.</p>
<p>"Did you bring the parts?" she asks again, louder this time. You aren't sure what parts she's looking for; you're here to figure out why the sand stopped.</p>
<p>"The parts! For the sand, yes! Come with me; I will show you." She beckons you onto the camel.</p>
<p>After riding a bit across the sands of Desert Island, you can see what look like very large rocks covering half of the horizon. The Elf explains that the rocks are all along the part of Desert Island that is directly above Island Island, making it hard to even get there. Normally, they use big machines to move the rocks and filter the sand, but the machines have broken down because Desert Island recently stopped receiving the <em>parts</em> they need to fix the machines.</p>
<p>You've already assumed it'll be your job to figure out why the parts stopped when she asks if you can help. You agree automatically.</p>
<p>Because the journey will take a few days, she offers to teach you the game of <em>Camel Cards</em>. Camel Cards is sort of similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands" target="_blank">poker</a> except it's designed to be easier to play while riding a camel.</p>
<p>In Camel Cards, you get a list of <em>hands</em>, and your goal is to order them based on the <em>strength</em> of each hand. A hand consists of <em>five cards</em> labeled one of <code>A</code>, <code>K</code>, <code>Q</code>, <code>J</code>, <code>T</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>8</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>3</code>, or <code>2</code>. The relative strength of each card follows this order, where <code>A</code> is the highest and <code>2</code> is the lowest.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-8"><h2>--- Day 8: Haunted Wasteland ---</h2><p>You're still riding a camel across Desert Island when you spot a sandstorm quickly approaching. When you turn to warn the Elf, she disappears before your eyes! To be fair, she had just finished warning you about <em>ghosts</em> a few minutes ago.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-9"><h2>--- Day 9: Mirage Maintenance ---</h2><p>You ride the camel through the sandstorm and stop where the ghost's maps told you to stop. <span title="The sound of a sandstorm slowly settling.">The sandstorm subsequently subsides, somehow seeing you standing at an <em>oasis</em>!</span></p>
<p>The camel goes to get some water and you stretch your neck. As you look up, you discover what must be yet another giant floating island, this one made of metal! That must be where the <em>parts to fix the sand machines</em> come from.</p>
<p>There's even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_gliding" target="_blank">hang glider</a> partially buried in the sand here; once the sun rises and heats up the sand, you might be able to use the glider and the hot air to get all the way up to the metal island!</p>
<p>While you wait for the sun to rise, you admire the oasis hidden here in the middle of Desert Island. It must have a delicate ecosystem; you might as well take some ecological readings while you wait. Maybe you can report any environmental instabilities you find to someone so the oasis can be around for the next sandstorm-worn traveler.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-10"><h2>--- Day 10: Pipe Maze ---</h2><p>You use the hang glider to ride the hot air from Desert Island all the way up to the floating metal island. This island is surprisingly cold and there definitely aren't any thermals to glide on, so you leave your hang glider behind.</p>
<p>You wander around for a while, but you don't find any people or animals. However, you do occasionally find signposts labeled "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_spring" target="_blank">Hot Springs</a>" pointing in a seemingly consistent direction; maybe you can find someone at the hot springs and ask them where the desert-machine parts are made.</p>
<p>The landscape here is alien; even the flowers and trees are made of metal. As you stop to admire some metal grass, you notice something metallic scurry away in your peripheral vision and jump into a big pipe! It didn't look like any animal you've ever seen; if you want a better look, you'll need to get ahead of it.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-11"><h2>--- Day 11: Cosmic Expansion ---</h2><p>You continue following signs for "Hot Springs" and eventually come across an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory" target="_blank">observatory</a>. The Elf within turns out to be a researcher studying cosmic expansion using the giant telescope here.</p>
<p>He doesn't know anything about the missing machine parts; he's only visiting for this research project. However, he confirms that the hot springs are the next-closest area likely to have people; he'll even take you straight there once he's done with today's observation analysis.</p>
<p>Maybe you can help him with the analysis to speed things up?</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-12"><h2>--- Day 12: Hot Springs ---</h2><p>You finally reach the hot springs! You can see steam rising from secluded areas attached to the primary, ornate building.</p>
<p>As you turn to enter, the <a href="11">researcher</a> stops you. "Wait - I thought you were looking for the hot springs, weren't you?" You indicate that this definitely looks like hot springs to you.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry, common mistake! This is actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen" target="_blank">onsen</a>! The hot springs are next door."</p>
<p>You look in the direction the researcher is pointing and suddenly notice the <span title="I love this joke. I'm not sorry.">massive metal helixes</span> towering overhead. "This way!"</p>
<p>It only takes you a few more steps to reach the main gate of the massive fenced-off area containing the springs. You go through the gate and into a small administrative building.</p>
<p>"Hello! What brings you to the hot springs today? Sorry they're not very hot right now; we're having a <em>lava shortage</em> at the moment." You ask about the missing machine parts for Desert Island.</p>
<p>"Oh, all of Gear Island is currently offline! Nothing is being manufactured at the moment, not until we get more lava to heat our forges. And our springs. The springs aren't very springy unless they're hot!"</p>
<p>"Say, could you go up and see why the lava stopped flowing? The springs are too cold for normal operation, but we should be able to find one springy enough to launch <em>you</em> up there!"</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-13"><h2>--- Day 13: Point of Incidence ---</h2><p>With your help, the hot springs team locates an appropriate spring which launches you neatly and precisely up to the edge of <em>Lava Island</em>.</p>
<p>There's just one problem: you don't see any <em>lava</em>.</p>
<p>You <em>do</em> see a lot of ash and igneous rock; there are even what look like gray mountains scattered around. After a while, you make your way to a nearby cluster of mountains only to discover that the valley between them is completely full of large <em>mirrors</em>.  Most of the mirrors seem to be aligned in a consistent way; perhaps you should head in that direction?</p>
<p>As you move through the valley of mirrors, you find that several of them have fallen from the large metal frames keeping them in place. The mirrors are extremely flat and shiny, and many of the fallen mirrors have lodged into the ash at strange angles. Because the terrain is all one color, it's hard to tell where it's safe to walk or where you're about to run into a mirror.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-14"><h2>--- Day 14: Parabolic Reflector Dish ---</h2><p>You reach the place where all of the mirrors were pointing: a massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_reflector" target="_blank">parabolic reflector dish</a> <span title="Why, where do you attach YOUR massive parabolic reflector dishes?">attached</span> to the side of another large mountain.</p>
<p>The dish is made up of many small mirrors, but while the mirrors themselves are roughly in the shape of a parabolic reflector dish, each individual mirror seems to be pointing in slightly the wrong direction. If the dish is meant to focus light, all it's doing right now is sending it in a vague direction.</p>
<p>This system must be what provides the energy for the lava! If you focus the reflector dish, maybe you can go where it's pointing and use the light to fix the lava production.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, the individual mirrors each appear to be connected via an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys to a large metal platform below the dish. The platform is covered in large rocks of various shapes. Depending on their position, the weight of the rocks deforms the platform, and the shape of the platform controls which ropes move and ultimately the focus of the dish.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-15"><h2>--- Day 15: Lens Library ---</h2><p>The newly-focused parabolic reflector dish is sending all of the collected light to a point on the side of yet another mountain - the largest mountain on Lava Island. As you approach the mountain, you find that the light is being collected by the wall of a large facility embedded in the mountainside.</p>
<p>You find a door under a large sign that says "Lava Production Facility" and next to a smaller sign that says "Danger - Personal Protective Equipment required beyond this point".</p>
<p>As you step inside, you are immediately greeted by a somewhat panicked <span title="do you like my hard hat">reindeer</span> wearing goggles and a loose-fitting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_hat" target="_blank">hard hat</a>. The reindeer leads you to a shelf of goggles and hard hats (you quickly find some that fit) and then further into the facility. At one point, you pass a button with a faint snout mark and the label "PUSH FOR HELP". No wonder you were loaded into that <a href="1">trebuchet</a> so quickly!</p>
<p>You pass through a final set of doors surrounded with even more warning signs and into what must be the room that collects all of the light from outside. As you admire the large assortment of lenses available to further focus the light, the reindeer brings you a book titled "Initialization Manual".</p>
<p>"Hello!", the book cheerfully begins, apparently unaware of the concerned reindeer reading over your shoulder. "This procedure will let you bring the Lava Production Facility online - all without burning or melting anything unintended!"</p>
<p>"Before you begin, please be prepared to use the Holiday ASCII String Helper algorithm (appendix 1A)." You turn to appendix 1A. The reindeer leans closer with interest.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-16"><h2>--- Day 16: The Floor Will Be Lava ---</h2><p>With the beam of light completely focused <em>somewhere</em>, the reindeer leads you deeper still into the Lava Production Facility. At some point, you realize that the steel facility walls have been replaced with cave, and the doorways are just cave, and the floor is cave, and you're pretty sure this is actually just a giant cave.</p>
<p>Finally, as you approach what must be the heart of the mountain, you see a bright light in a cavern up ahead. There, you discover that the <span title="Not anymore, there's a blanket!">beam</span> of light you so carefully focused is emerging from the cavern wall closest to the facility and pouring all of its energy into a contraption on the opposite side.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, the contraption appears to be a flat, two-dimensional square grid containing <em>empty space</em> (<code>.</code>), <em>mirrors</em> (<code>/</code> and <code>\</code>), and <em>splitters</em> (<code>|</code> and <code>-</code>).</p>
<p>The contraption is aligned so that most of the beam bounces around the grid, but each tile on the grid converts some of the beam's light into <em>heat</em> to melt the rock in the cavern.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-17"><h2>--- Day 17: Clumsy Crucible ---</h2><p>The lava starts flowing rapidly once the Lava Production Facility is operational. As you <span title="see you soon?">leave</span>, the reindeer offers you a parachute, allowing you to quickly reach Gear Island.</p>
<p>As you descend, your bird's-eye view of Gear Island reveals why you had trouble finding anyone on your way up: half of Gear Island is empty, but the half below you is a giant factory city!</p>
<p>You land near the gradually-filling pool of lava at the base of your new <em>lavafall</em>. Lavaducts will eventually carry the lava throughout the city, but to make use of it immediately, Elves are loading it into large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible" target="_blank">crucibles</a> on wheels.</p>
<p>The crucibles are top-heavy and pushed by hand. Unfortunately, the crucibles become very difficult to steer at high speeds, and so it can be hard to go in a straight line for very long.</p>
<p>To get Desert Island the machine parts it needs as soon as possible, you'll need to find the best way to get the crucible <em>from the lava pool to the machine parts factory</em>. To do this, you need to minimize <em>heat loss</em> while choosing a route that doesn't require the crucible to go in a <em>straight line</em> for too long.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-18"><h2>--- Day 18: Lavaduct Lagoon ---</h2><p>Thanks to your efforts, the machine parts factory is one of the first factories up and running since the lavafall came back. However, to catch up with the large backlog of parts requests, the factory will also need a <em>large supply of lava</em> for a while; the Elves have already started creating a large lagoon nearby for this purpose.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-19"><h2>--- Day 19: Aplenty ---</h2><p>The Elves of Gear Island are thankful for your help and send you on your way. They even have a hang glider that someone <a href="9">stole</a> from Desert Island; since you're already going that direction, it would help them a lot if you would use it to get down there and return it to them.</p>
<p>As you reach the bottom of the <em>relentless avalanche of machine parts</em>, you discover that they're already forming a formidable heap. Don't worry, though - a group of Elves is already here organizing the parts, and they have a <span title="This part sparks joy. This part sparks joy. This part ALSO sparks joy... I think we need a different system."><em>system</em></span>.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-20"><h2>--- Day 20: Pulse Propagation ---</h2><p>With your help, the Elves manage to find the right parts and fix all of the machines. Now, they just need to send the command to boot up the machines and get the sand flowing again.</p>
<p>The machines are far apart and wired together with long <em>cables</em>. The cables don't connect to the machines directly, but rather to communication <em>modules</em> attached to the machines that perform various initialization tasks and also act as communication relays.</p>
<p>Modules communicate using <em>pulses</em>. Each pulse is either a <em>high pulse</em> or a <em>low pulse</em>. When a module sends a pulse, it sends that type of pulse to each module in its list of <em>destination modules</em>.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-21"><h2>--- Day 21: Step Counter ---</h2><p>You manage to catch the <a href="7">airship</a> right as it's dropping someone else off on their all-expenses-paid trip to Desert Island! It even helpfully drops you off near the <a href="5">gardener</a> and his massive farm.</p>
<p>"You got the sand flowing again! Great work! Now we just need to wait until we have enough sand to filter the water for Snow Island and we'll have snow again in no time."</p>
<p>While you wait, one of the Elves that works with the gardener heard how good you are at solving problems and would like your help. He needs to get his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometer" target="_blank">steps</a> in for the day, and so he'd like to know <em>which garden plots he can reach with exactly his remaining <code>64</code> steps</em>.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-22"><h2>--- Day 22: Sand Slabs ---</h2><p>Enough sand has fallen; it can finally filter water for Snow Island.</p>
<p>Well, <em>almost</em>.</p>
<p>The sand has been falling as large compacted <em>bricks</em> of sand, piling up to form an impressive stack here near the edge of Island Island. In order to make use of the sand to filter water, some of the bricks will need to be broken apart - nay, <em><span title="Disintegrate - X,R&#10;Sorcery&#10;Destroy X target bricks of sand. They cannot be regenerated. Create 32768 0/1 colorless Sand artifact creature tokens for each brick of sand destroyed in this way.">disintegrated</span></em> - back into freely flowing sand.</p>
<p>The stack is tall enough that you'll have to be careful about choosing which bricks to disintegrate; if you disintegrate the wrong brick, large portions of the stack could topple, which sounds pretty dangerous.</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-23"><h2>--- Day 23: A Long Walk ---</h2><p>The Elves resume water filtering operations! Clean water starts flowing over the edge of Island Island.</p>
<p>They offer to help <em>you</em> go over the edge of Island Island, too! Just <span title="It'll be fiiiiiiiine.">hold on tight</span> to one end of this impossibly long rope and they'll lower you down a safe distance from the massive waterfall you just created.</p>
<p>As you finally reach Snow Island, you see that the water isn't really reaching the ground: it's being <em>absorbed by the air</em> itself. It looks like you'll finally have a little downtime while the moisture builds up to snow-producing levels. Snow Island is pretty scenic, even without any snow; why not take a walk?</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-24"><h2>--- Day 24: Never Tell Me The Odds ---</h2><p>It seems like something is going wrong with the snow-making process. Instead of forming snow, the water that's been absorbed into the air seems to be forming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail" target="_blank">hail</a>!</p>
<p>Maybe there's something you can do to break up the hailstones?</p>
</article><article class="day-desc" id="day-25"><h2>--- Day 25: Snowverload ---</h2><p><em>Still</em> somehow without snow, you go to the last place you haven't checked: the center of Snow Island, directly below the waterfall.</p>
<p>Here, someone has clearly been trying to fix the problem. Scattered everywhere are hundreds of weather machines, almanacs, communication modules, hoof prints, machine parts, mirrors, lenses, and so on.</p>
<p>Somehow, everything has been <em>wired together</em> into a massive snow-producing apparatus, but nothing seems to be running. You check a tiny screen on one of the communication modules: <code>Error 2023</code>. It doesn't say what <code>Error 2023</code> means, but it <em>does</em> have the phone number for a support line printed on it.</p>
<p>"Hi, you've reached Weather Machines And So On, Inc. How can I help you?" You explain the situation.</p>
<p>"Error 2023, you say? Why, that's a power overload error, of course! It means you have too many components plugged in. Try unplugging some components and--" You explain that there are hundreds of components here and you're in a bit of a hurry.</p>
